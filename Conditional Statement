QUESTION:
Write a Python program to read marks of a student and display the grade based on the following conditions using if–elif–else:
Marks ≥ 90 → Grade A
Marks ≥ 75 and < 90 → Grade B
Marks ≥ 60 and < 75 → Grade C
Marks ≥ 40 and < 60 → Grade D
Marks < 40 → Fail
Also check if the entered marks are valid (0–100).

CODE:
marks = int(input("Enter marks: "))

if marks < 0 or marks > 100:
    print("Invalid marks")
elif marks >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade B")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade C")
elif marks >= 40:
    print("Grade D")
else:
    print("Fail")

OUTPUT:
Enter marks: 69
Grade C 

OBSERVATION:
The program correctly assigns grades based on marks using if–elif–else.
Invalid marks (<0 or >100) are handled.
Each marks range is exclusive, so only one grade is printed.
Top-to-bottom checking ensures the first matching condition is executed.

QUESTION:
Write a Python program to calculate the electricity bill based on the following conditions:
First 100 units → ₹1 per unit
Next 100 units → ₹2 per unit
Above 200 units → ₹3 per unit
Display the total bill amount.

CODE:
units = int(input("Enter total units consumed: "))

if units <= 100:
    bill = units * 1
elif units <= 200:
    bill = 100 * 1 + (units - 100) * 2
else:
    bill = 100 * 1 + 100 * 2 + (units - 200) * 3

print("Total Electricity Bill = ₹", bill)

OUTPUT:
Enter total units consumed: 169
Total Electricity Bill = ₹ 238

OBSERVATION:
The program calculates the bill based on unit ranges using if–elif–else.
First 100 units are charged at ₹1/unit, next 100 at ₹2/unit, and above 200 at ₹3/unit.
Only the matching range is executed, making calculation accurate and efficient.
Works correctly for edge cases like 100, 200, or more units.
