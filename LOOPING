QUESTION:
Write a Python program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop with the following conditions:
Use the pass statement when the number is 4.
Skip printing the number 6 using the continue statement.
Stop the loop when the number reaches 9 using the break statement.

CODE:
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 4:
        pass          # no operation
    elif i == 6:
        continue      # skip 6
    elif i == 9:
        break         # exit loop

    print(i)

OUTPUT:
1
2
3
4
5
7
8

OBSERVATION:
pass does nothing, so the number 4 is printed.
continue skips only the current iteration, so 6 is not printed.
break stops the loop when 9 is reached.
Loop execution ends immediately after break.


QUESTION:
Write a Python program using a while loop to display numbers from 1 to 7 and demonstrate the use of pass, continue, and break:
Use pass when the value is 2.
Skip printing 5 using continue.
Terminate the loop when the value becomes 6 using break.

CODE:
i = 1
while i <= 7:
    if i == 2:
        pass          # placeholder
    elif i == 5:
        i += 1
        continue      # skip 5
    elif i == 6:
        break         # stop loop

    print(i)
    i += 1

OUTPUT:
1
2
3
4

Observation:
pass has no effect on execution flow.
continue skips printing 5, but the loop continues.
break terminates the loop when 6 is encountered.
In a while loop, updating the loop variable is necessary to avoid infinite loops.
