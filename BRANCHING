QUESTION:
Write a Python program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop with the following conditions:
Skip printing the number 3 using the continue statement.
Stop the loop completely when the number reaches 8 using the break statement.
Print all other numbers that satisfy the above conditions.

CODE:
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 3:
        continue   # skip 3

    if i == 8:
        break      # stop loop at 8

    print(i)
OUTPUT:
1
2
4
5
6
7

OBSERVATION:
continue skips the current iteration when i == 3, so 3 is not printed.
break terminates the loop completely when i == 8.
Statements after break are never executed.
Loop runs only until the break condition is met.



QUESTION:

Write a Python program to iterate through numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop and demonstrate the use of pass, continue, and break statements with the following conditions:
When the value is 2, use the pass statement (no action is performed).
When the value is 4, skip the current iteration using the continue statement.
When the value is 5, terminate the loop using the break statement.
Print all numbers that are processed before the loop terminates.

CODE:

for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 2:
        pass      # does nothing, placeholder

    elif i == 4:
        continue  # skip 4

    elif i == 5:
        break     # stop loop

    print(i)

OUTPUT:
1
2
3

OBSERVATION:
pass does nothing; it just allows the program to continue normally.
Even though i == 2 has pass, 2 is still printed.
continue skips printing 4.
break stops the loop when i == 5, so 5 is not printed.
pass is mainly used as a placeholder where code is required syntactically.
